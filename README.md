#User Story#

LGBT bar-goers don't have many options when it comes to locating LGBT-friendly venues--in fact, most people rely on print publications, or friends (or friends of friends) in San Francisco. But what if a user could pull out his or her phone and visualize where the nearest gay bars are, displaying the most up-to-date venue information from a trusted, publicly accessible API like Foursquare.

Last Call is a simple, one-page application, mobile/hybrid application that does ONE thing really well: It helps users find bars.

#Here's what a user's experience would be like using the app:#

 - Users first see a map of San Francisco auto-populated with all of Ssan Francisco's LGBT bars as pins.
 - Upon tap, each pin will display an info window with location name, address and a link to the bar's external website.
 - A user will have the option to save a venue in his or her repertoire of favorites. Maps will not be saved; rather, a user will be saving bar information, which will then be rendered to his/her profile view.
 - A user will have the option to draw a route between his/her current location and a venue. This command should appear in an expanded info window.
 - A user can view his/her profile by clicking a button on the top-left of the main screen. A hidden div will slide out from the left. If a user has already signed up and signed in, their profile will display, along with a list of favorite bars. On click, the map will zoom to that particular bar. (Stretch: A route between the user's location and that bar will be rendered to the map.)
 - Note: Users can always use the app whether or not they are logged in, but only signed-in users can save favorites to their profile.
